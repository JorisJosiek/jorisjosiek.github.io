*Welcome to my personal website! My name is Joris and I am currently a senior Master's student working in the stellar astrophysics group at the [Observatory of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/sciences/astro/en/).*

My research interests revolve around understanding the structure and evolution of high-mass stars. In my work, I use theoretical and computational modeling techniques to understand the different processes that govern a star's life in an attempt to test, confine and improve the validity of our stellar models. Starting in September, I will be pursuing a PhD at the University of Heidelberg, where I will be working at the interface of stellar evolution and stellar atmospheres modeling.

On this website, you will find information about my academic background and research experience in the "CV" and "Research" sections. In the "Writing" section, I will post some of the little things I find interesting in and around my field including coding tools and tutorials, cool math problems, and exciting science news. In the future, I also intend to use it as a platform for more elaborate articles and discussions related to astrophysics and academia.

If you are interested in my research and would like to know more, feel free to get in touch with me via email at [joris.josiek@etu.unige.ch](joris.josiek@etu.unige.ch). Whether you are a fellow researcher or an enthusiast of astronomy, I am always happy to engage in discussions and share my passion for this captivating field!
