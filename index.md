*Welcome to my personal website! My name is Joris and I am currently a Ph.D. student working in the [Emmy Noether Research Group on Stellar Atmospheres and Mass Loss](https://wwwstaff.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/ansander/) at the Astromisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) of the University of Heidelberg.*

My research interests revolve around understanding the structure and evolution of high-mass stars. In my work, I use theoretical and computational modeling techniques to understand the different processes that govern a star's life in an attempt to test, confine and improve the validity of our stellar models. I am focussing in particular on processes taking place in the atmospheres of massive stars and how these can affect the star as a whole.

On this website, you will find information about my academic background and research experience in the "CV" and "Research" sections.

If you are interested in my research and would like to know more, feel free to get in touch with me via email at [joris.josiek@uni-heidelberg.de](joris.josiek@uni-heidelberg.de). Whether you are a fellow researcher or an enthusiast of astronomy, I am always happy to engage in discussions and share my passion for this captivating field!
